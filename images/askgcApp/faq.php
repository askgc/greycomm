	<h1 align="left" style="color:green;"> Reserving Studio Time - FAQ </h1> 
	<h2 align="left" style="color:green;"> How do I reserve studio time? </h2> 
	
    	<p>  GreyComm is always happy to share our great studio with Loyola students. If you would 
            like to reserve time in the studio, email gctv@loyola.edu at least 3-5 days prior to when you 
            want to reserve the space. <br> 
        
        <br> 
        
         <b> Please keep a few things in mind: </b> <br>
            <br>
            1. GreyComm Studios reserves the right to reject requests for studio space and <br>
            change reservations at anytime. <br> 
            <br>
            2. If your request is granted and you/your group is late <i> without properly notifying <br>
            GreyComm Management </i> your reservation will be lost. <br>
            <br> 
            3. if you do not clean up the studio after you are finished with your shoot you may <br>
            lose the ability to make reservations for the rest of the semester. <br>
            <br> 
            4. GreyComm Studios is not responsible for lost footage or technical difficulties. <br>
            We will assist you in anyway possible.  Although rare, technology can fail, therefore <br>
            you are working at your own risk. </p> </div>
